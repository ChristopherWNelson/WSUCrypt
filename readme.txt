wsu_crypt is a block-encryption program  that uses a 64 bit block size and 64 bit key.
This program takes a standard ASCII text file, called "plaintext.txt", and a HEX text file,
called "key.txt", as inputs. It outputs a HEX text file called "cyphertext.txt" which is
the encryption of the input file. It also outputs a ASCII text file called "decypher.txt",
which is the decryption of the "cyphertext.txt" file.

To run the program, run the wsu_crypt.java file in an IDE such as Eclipse, or compile and 
run it. Two files called "plaintext.txt" and "key.txt" are required for the encryption 
algorithm to work.
